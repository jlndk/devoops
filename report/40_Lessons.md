## Lessons Learned Perspective

Describe the biggest issues, how you solved them, and which are major lessons learned with regards to:
- evolution and refactoring
- operation, and
- maintenance

of your ITU-MiniTwit systems. Link back to respective commit messages, issues, tickets, etc. to illustrate these.

Also reflect and describe what was the "DevOps" style of your work. For example, what did you do differently to previous development projects and how did it work?
